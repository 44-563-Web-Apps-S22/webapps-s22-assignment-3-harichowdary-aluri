    Oy is a movie released in the year 2009 and it is a Indian Telugu-language romantic drama film.
    The story revolves around Uday (Siddharth) is a rich and spoilt brat who believes in short term pleasures.
     Sandhya (Shamili) is a loner who lives on her own. She is a responsible girl with long term plans and 
     strict principles. Uday falls in love with Sandhya at the very first sight. And he joins her place as a paying guest. 
     When everything is going well, Uday comes to know that Sandhya is suffering from cancer and her days are numbered. 
     But Sandhya is not aware of it. The rest of the story is all about how Uday makes Sandhya realise all her unfulfilled wishes..
